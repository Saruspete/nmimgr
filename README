------------
What is this
------------

Manage NMI events in a more fine-grained manner than "uknown_nmi_panic".
When a production host is unresponsive, we'd like to take a Kernel Dump for
offline issue analysis.
If kdump is correctly setup, we need to crash/panic the system for it to start

This is usually done by sending an NMI to the system (as no userland process
is responding anymore) through the BMC (vendor specific).

But if no handler registers the vendor-specific NMI event to trigger a crash,
the kernel logs a "Dazed and confused, but trying to continue" message and 
server is still unresponsive.

How to use it
-------------

Build it
--------

Built it for the current kernel:
  # make

Or specify custom/multiple versions if you have a build env
  # make 2.6.32-642.15.1.el6.x86_64 3.10.0-327.36.1.el7.x86_64 4.8.13-100.fc23.x86_64


Load the module (temporarily)
-----------------------------

Usage as a module (temp, insmod):
 insmod nmimgr.ko events_panic=0,1,2,5-12,13,255 events_ignore=99



Check the logs
--------------

As NMI should be a serious indicator, the module will generate some logs at
startup and when handling a new NMI.

When trying new hardware, you may just load the module, generate an NMI from
the BMC and check dmesg for lines containing "nmimgr:", specifically the log
"Handling new NMI". 
The code you are interested in (the event) is the decimal value between ( )

If you see this log: "Handling new NMI type:1 event:0x10 (16)"
Then the event code generated is 16.
To make the system panic:
  # insmod nmimgr.ko events_panic=16
To ignore it and disable messages:
  # insmod nmimgr.ko events_ignore=16


Add it permanently
------------------

Once checked it works with your kernel, you can make it more permanent:

1) copy the module (file nmimgr.ko) in:
    # cp nmimgr.kmod.$(uname -r)/nmimgr.ko /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/extra/
2) Regen the module database:
    # depmod -a
3) Set the parameters for modprobe:
    # echo "options nmimgr events_panic=16" > /etc/modprobe.d/nmimgr.conf
4) Load it with modprobe
    # modprobe nmimgr
5) Check the parameters are correctly set (you should see your value)
    # cat /sys/module/nmimgr/parameters/events_panic


	
Parameters
----------

- events_panic=LIST  Events to make the kernel Panic
- events_ignore=LIST Events to drop, so no other handler can process them

LIST is standard kernel lists, can be composed of 
- simple lists:  0,13,16,44,10
- ranges:        10-100
- Mix of both:   0,1,2-8,10



Should you embed it with your kernel, you can configure it with boot cmd:
  nmimgr.events_panic=0,1,2,5-12,13,255 nmimgr.events_ignore=99

How to test it
--------------

Generate an NMI
---------------

- openipmi chassis power diag
- vboxmanage debugvm "VMName" injectnmi
- virsh inject-nmi "VMName"


Usual generated NMI events (in decimal, to be used as module parameters):
- HP Ilo : 32,48
- Dell IDRAC: 32,33,48,49
- IBM : 44,60
- VirtualBox: 0,16,32,48

Kernel Revision history
-----------------------

2.6.32: Using notifier_block structs
3.2   : Moved NMI descriptions to an enum: LOCAL, UNKNOWN, MAX 
        https://lwn.net/Articles/461215/
        https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/3/8/386
3.5   : Moved "register_nmi_handler" to a macro + static struct nmiaction fn##_na
        This broke the loop logic used between 3.2 and 3.5
